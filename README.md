Quote Generator(vanilla.JS)

The purpose of this project was to manipulate the dom and create a simple dynamic page to hold a quote and display the author separately without using a object to hold the information.



step 1 make two arrays to hold the information i want to display 

step 2 select the divs i wanted to manipulate in the html by the id name.

step 3 add an event listener to the page so when it is clicked a function can be run

step 4 assign a function to randomly choose a number to use this value to select a quote 

step 5 create a function to take the random number value and use it to get information from the arrays to append their content to the designated spot in the html
